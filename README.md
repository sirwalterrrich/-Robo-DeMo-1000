# -Robo-DeMo-1000
This project centers around a 4 wheeled robot that follows or leads distance runners. It identifies other runners by use of computer vision and then proceeds to either start motivating or demotivating the other identified runners through speech audio by leveraging text to speech AI services and computer vision ML models.
